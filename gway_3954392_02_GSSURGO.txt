  Description:
    Purpose: The Gridded SSURGO dataset was created for use in national,
      regional, and state-wide resource planning and analysis of
      soils data. The raster map layer data can be readily combined
      with other national, regional, and local raster layer

      Process_Description: 
This dataset is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data 
developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information 
onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This 
dataset consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area 
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a 
repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The soil map units are 
linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System (NASIS) relational database, which gives the proportionate 
extent of the component soils and their properties.

During the third week of January 2014, all available SSURGO data were downloaded from Web Soil Survey to a local cache. As 
part of the download process, the tabular data for each survey were imported into individual SSURGO template databases 
(MS Access format) using a custom set of 'SSURGO Download Tools' for ArcGIS 10.1. For each state or territory, intersecting 
SSURGO datasets were identified using the 'laoverlap' table (Legend Area Overlap). The selected datasets were merged and 
converted from shapefile and MS Access tables into a single ESRI file geodatabase for that state or territory. The data 
were not clipped to a state boundary, thus in some instances feature classes may extend beyond a state's boundary. All 
datasets were projected from the original Geographic WGS 1984 coordinate system to the appropriate Albers Equal Area 
Conic coordinate system. Relationship classes between tables and feature classes were created in the geodatabase.

A 10 meter file geodatabase raster layer was created by converting the 'MUPOLYGON' feature class from feature to raster 
using 'FeatureToRaster' which is a cell-center-based method in ArcGIS 10.1. Where available, the raster layer was aligned 
to the USGS NLCD raster. Pyramids and a raster attribute table were created. A single attribute 'MUKEY' was added to the 
raster attribute table to facilitate joins with the attribute data.
