202007 gSSURGO database. Created using SSURGO data from the July 2020 Refresh.

Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) is similar to the standard USDA-NRCS Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database product but in the format of an Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI®) file geodatabase. A file geodatabase has the capacity to store much more data and thus greater spatial extents than the traditional SSURGO product. This makes it possible to offer these data in statewide or even Conterminous United States (CONUS) tiles. gSSURGO contains all of the original soil attribute tables in SSURGO. All spatial data are stored within the geodatabase instead of externally as separate shapefiles. Both SSURGO and gSSURGO are considered products of the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) partnership.
